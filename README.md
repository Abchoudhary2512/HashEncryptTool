# HashEncryptTool

## Overview

Welcome to the Cryptographic Toolbox, a versatile platform that empowers you to perform various cryptographic operations using state-of-the-art algorithms. Whether you need to hash data, generate secure passwords, or implement advanced encryption techniques, this toolbox has you covered.

## Supported Algorithms

### 1. SHA-256

Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit is a widely used cryptographic hash function that produces a fixed-size 256-bit hash value. It is commonly employed for data integrity verification.

### 2. SHA-512

Similar to SHA-256, SHA-512 produces a 512-bit hash value. This algorithm is known for its robustness and is often used in security-sensitive applications.

### 3. Password Generator

Generate strong and secure passwords with our password generator. This tool ensures the creation of complex passwords, enhancing the overall security of your systems.

### 4. RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)

RSA is a widely used asymmetric cryptographic algorithm for secure data transmission. It involves the use of public and private keys, providing a secure means of communication and data exchange.

### 5. 3DES (Triple Data Encryption Standard)

Triple DES is a symmetric-key block cipher that applies the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm three times to each data block. Although older, it still offers a high level of security.

## Security Considerations

- Ensure that sensitive data is handled securely.
- Keep private keys confidential, especially in the case of asymmetric algorithms like RSA.
- Use generated passwords responsibly and store them securely.

## Disclaimer

This platform is provided as-is, and the algorithms implemented are standard cryptographic techniques. However, it is essential to use them responsibly and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
